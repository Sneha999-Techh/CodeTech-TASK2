* Adding tasks to a daily list.
* Editing and deleting tasks from the list.
* Saving the tasks at the end of the day.
* Viewing and clearing previously saved tasks.
* Providing a smooth and intuitive user experience with real-time updates and task persistence using localStorage.
  
--**Key Features:**

1] Task Management:

* Users can add tasks by typing into a text input field.
* Each task can be edited or deleted.
* Tasks are displayed in a list format with options for each task.
  
2] Save Tasks for the Day:

* Users can save the tasks they've added for the day.
* Saved tasks are displayed with the date they were saved.
* The task list is cleared after saving the tasks for the day.
  
3] Saved Tasks Section:

* Users can view the tasks saved on specific days.
* There is a "Clear All" button to remove all saved tasks from the saved tasks section.
  
4] User Interaction:

--**Technologies Used:**

**1] HTML:**
* The structure of the application, including the layout, input fields, buttons, and task list, is created using HTML.
  
**2] CSS:**

* Styling for the application is done using CSS to create a visually appealing design. Flexbox is used for the layout, and custom animations are applied for smooth transitions and task item appearance.
* The color scheme is dark-themed with yellow accents, making the application easy on the eyes.
  
**3] JavaScript:**

* The core functionality of the application, including adding tasks, editing tasks, saving tasks, and managing the task list, is implemented using JavaScript.
* The localStorage API is used to store tasks persistently across sessions, ensuring that tasks remain available even after a page refresh.
  
**4] Local Storage:**

* Tasks are stored in the browserâ€™s localStorage for persistence, which helps save and retrieve tasks without needing a server-side database.
